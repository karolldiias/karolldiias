## Hi there 👋

I am a software engineering student and have worked as a product owner and in quality assurance. 

At the moment, I am learning how to create a system for a small school that needs more control of the business.

Currently, I am learning more about JAVA and looking for a new job opportunity. 

How to find me: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karolinealvesfernandesdias/) 

Fun fact: I play guitar acoustic and love learning.
